# Intro Olivia Grabher

A simple Website with basic Information about me and my work including contact information. 

## The problem

My problem was that I had a clear idea of what I wanted to implement. However, I soon realised that I couldn't implement it so easily and quickly with my current knowledge. So I started with a simple HTML code and added step by step links, pictures etc. to it. In the same way I handled it with the CSS code. My page consists of simple elements, which I want to add little by little. There is missing a corresponding footer, a better presentation of the projects and a more pleasant design.
