    <h2 class="🦈">Welcome Shark lovers</h2>
    <p>This page is about the <span class="stress">most fascinating and unknown"</span> species in the ocean.
      The sharks are ones of the oldest species on the planet.They are essential for the well-being of the oceans. There
      are around 1000 known species of sharks.
      Unfortunately,it suffers from the industrial fishing and its bad reputation because of the famous movies <span
        class="stress">Jaws</span>
      Humans do not really know those magnificent beasts and fail to understand that they are the only "lords of the
      seas".</p>
    <p>Here is a description from WWF's website:</p>
    <blockquote id="check" cite="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/shark">
      These majestic top predators that are so essential to the natural order of marine ecosystems now face their most
      severe threat from overfishing. Many species are threatened with extinction, with some families of rays such as
      sawfishes in peril. While sharks and rays have been an irreplaceable resource for coastal communities in the
      developing world for centuries, this unique balance is in danger of being lost forever.
      With our oceans severely degraded, restoring sharks is key to improving the resilience of these water bodies to
      climate change. While sharks' diverse range of species adds complexity to our conservation efforts, the dwindling
      numbers of these amazing creatures from overfishing and demand for their fins and meat increases the urgency of
      the task. Through our multi-pronged strategies, and guided by the Global Priorities for Conserving Sharks and Rays
      - A 2015-2025 Strategy, we strive to restore the balance between humans and sharks.
