        <h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
        <br>Hello there!
        <br>
        <br>I'm Line from Norway, currently living in Oslo but from a small place on the west coast.
        <br>
        <br>For work I'm a Technical support person for a big Media company called Schibsted where I've been since 2012 in different parts of the company(and daughter companies).
        <br>This also led me to work in London for two years, before returning back home.
        <br>
        <br>On my freetime I like to travel and playing games. Due to 2020 being as it is there has been a lot more gaming then travelling.
        <br>
        <br>Random fact: My nickname is Monkey, due to I always climbed tree as a kid and fell down as I didn't know how to get down from there in any other way and I still don't know how :)
