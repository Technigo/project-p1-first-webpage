# The lords of the seas

- Just wanted to create a website about sharks
- Created different pages to cover the topic under different aspects/contents (documentaries, books, associations and so) or at least trigger an interest

## The problem

I started to think about  what kind of content I would like to add such as videos, link about books and associations and so on. I did a bit  of research in order to find the content. It helped me also to find out what kind of elements I should use.

Then I used the Technigo template, which is pretty useful to organize the thought and not get messy. 
I set up the structures through HTML, adding the content and have a pre-look. I tried to think as much ahead as possible with the "class" and "id" (talked a bit with Maksymilian about it through Slack).

I might have spend a bit too much time on trying to figure out which element was best between <nav> and <menu>. Same for <section> and <div>. I tried to use as many elements that I could find and could be relevant, from w3schools (ex: <blockquote> / <pre> but the predefined settings for this one got me a bit frustrated so I decided to remove it and use the <p>.)

Then I used the CSS, using all the tips and recommendations from the different modules.
I reused the menu "template"(menu / menu:a / menu a:hover) provided in one of the modules. I then tried to order all the selectors according from "use in every page" to "use only once". I checked w3schools as well as the "slack" or even checked on other websites through Google.


To prepare everything, I used VS code and then look for information in the technigo modules or other websites.

If I had more time, I would then focus on getting a contact form in the "about" page to exchange ideas or getting feedback. I would also adding some links to social networks.
