    <h2 class="ðŸ¦ˆ">The main reasons behind those webpages</h2>
    <p>My name is Pierre Clavel and have been a "shark-lover" since a very young age. I had the luck to discover those
      beautiful animals through documentaries.
      I was not allowed at that time to watch Jaws (thank you mom!). This website was created only for the purpose of a
      project. The different pages that you can find are not meant to be updated with new content.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>It is important to keep in mind that this is an amateur website from someone that has a strong interest in
      sharks.
      I strongly recommend you to cross check the information that you would find on that website before using it for
      any other purposes.</p>
