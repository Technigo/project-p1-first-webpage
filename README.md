# Spis meg 

Spis Meg should contribute to reducing food waste by providing a library of recipies that matches the ingredients use already have in their fridge.  

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
I used the planning teamplate provded by Technigo in the "Fall in love with code. Create your first webpage" project. If I had more time I would investigate how to structure the content using the box model, experiment with better styling. I would also try to add check boxes for ingredients.
