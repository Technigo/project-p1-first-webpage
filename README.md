# CV Website

Practice html and css with my own project. My project is my CV as a Website. I wanted to create a project that doesnt only last for the time of this course. Since a CV can always be worked on I figured this is the perfect project, since i can always and forever update it and use my new set of skills for it.

## The problem

The problem was, that i didn't have enough theoretical knowledge of some stylings I wanted to implement. My approach was to look for solutions on youtube, google and so on. I found some solutions to my problems, but only partly. It was more copying what other people have done instead of really understanding.
