# Project Name

Creating a website using what the course teached me and also some knowledge I had from before to create a website that can be navigate

## The problem

Had issues with getting the boxes to align which each other and have the images on the gallery page to be centered in the middle. After searching a bit around the web without finding a good way(mostly looked on w3schools.com) I asked a friend of mine for help with what to write in the CSS file.

For finding colors that would fit together I used colorswall.com and tried different hexcodes until I was happy with the result

Also had problem with link to gallery page from the home page, but that was due to the gallery file was not in the correct map on my laptop.

If I had more time I would tried to learn how to make the images open as a pop up instead of a new tab


## View it live

I have not deployed the project anywhere
