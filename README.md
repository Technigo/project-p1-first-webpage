# Travel to Japan & South Korea

A trip to Japan and South Korea is being planned. This website informs friends what is planned.

Although I somewhat planned this project, it came out entirely different than intially planned. Basic HTML and CSS was used to complete this project. I have not yet fully grasped the concept of classes. The next steps are to rearrange the website, add more elements into the header (e.g. h1) and add a two- or three-column layout to the text elements.
