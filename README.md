# I made this website to learn how to use HTML and CSS for the first time.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

# My boyfriend own a cleaning company and dosn't have a website yet because he never needed. I wanted to use this opportunity to experience coding on this project and at the end I could make it live if I like the result.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## For the 3rd part and final part of this project I' ve tried to implement some javascript, which was kind of hard to manage since we don't have foundamentals on it. I fixed the code, looking a bit more organized from first project. I've insert also some extra html to create different webpages linked in the main menu. All the links are funtional. I've insert a functional form and linked it to Formspree to collect submissions and works! ( thanks to my coach Nadia who found me perfect alternative to Netifly). I've published my website on my hosting (siteground.com), through the c-panel i could upload all the files and my website it's live. To develop this website I've used some help from codepen (image slider before/after), chat GPT (img with content on overlay).
