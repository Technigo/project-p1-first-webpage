# Olavida Surfschool

I did this small website to learn the Basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScrippt during my course at Code Excursion.

I have chosen the Olavida Surfschool, because I have already built this website via Wordpress some years ago. And I tried to build the individual blocks from scratch with HTML, CSS, etc. 

In the meantime the wordpress site doesn't exist anymore (because the school was closed by my friends), so the links on this project don't work anymore. 

It was a very exciting experience for me and a lot of fun to design the single website elements. 

## The problem

For me, the challenge was partly to make the individual design elements exactly the same as on the WordPress site was. However, if I have not found the appropriate code directly, I looked it up at some helpful websites (W3School, etc.).

## View it live

No - unfortunately not. Because in the meantime the Surfschool closed down. But I am highly motivated in case my friends open a new school, that I am building them a website again. An this time from scatch with coding and not with the wordpress plugins;-)
