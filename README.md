# Penguin Project

This is a brief page about penguins for the first project within the Code Excursion course, created with html and styled with css.

## The problem

- I enjoyed the creative part of the project and started out by trying out functions and creating the parts of the project on the go. Google was a great help for many issues and problems as well as for some nice extra functions!
- Challenges: keeping the code clean. I'm not sure if I made it more complicated than necessary or if there might be a more efficient way to set up my page. Also had some Github issues and I think I uploaded the incorrect package resp. did two uploads of different levels of the files and I deleted and started fresh. Thus the late upload and missing history.
I also I had issues to deploy the project as per instructions on Netlify (did not understand the build part) but managed to set it up via the drag&drop.
- If I had more time: I'm not 100% happy with the readability of the header text. I did not find a solution to only apply opacity/transparency to the header image and not to the text. By googling the best solution seems to be to edit the header image separately and then load a more transparent version of it onto the page. Instead, I tried to improve the readability with shadows for a quick fix. And of course I'd add more personalized content :)
