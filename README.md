# CodeExcursion - Flower Subscription Service

Assignment: Create your first webpage!

The idea is to create a webpage for a flower delivery service, where users can sign up for a subscription model and get regional flowers delivered home on a regular basis. 

## The problem

Handed in already since I'm on vacation till beginning of October :)

What would be next:
Add a third "highlighter box" with more content and also fill in the additional pages with some content. 
Try to align the 3 highlighter boxes so that they fit in a row. 
Curious to see how to make that responsive in the next lessons!


Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Have you deployed your project somewhere? Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
