# Project JO Gommiswald

It's the webpage of our Skiclub. We train kids in skiing and we use the webpage mainly for organization with the parents.

## The problem
The tab 'Termine' is supposed to be interactive and with some links, but I havn't been able to do that yet. 
Also, I would like to add a registration form in 'Kontakt' and of course the real adresses.
