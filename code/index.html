      The Corona pandemic has thrown many challenges at us and led us to question our everyday routines. I take some time in this blog post to dive into everyday observations from lockdown life – in this first edition on how we as a society handle time.

      Last weekend, I was on a bike tour and taking a break on a bench at the edge of the forest overlooking the village below. I was staring into space and enjoying the warmth of the spring sun, when I wondered if we should start heading back. Not wearing a watch, I was just about to pull my smartphone out of my pocket, when I realized that the church tower was right in our view and held a very visible answer to my question. This is when I started wondering, when time became such an important information that it had to be displayed so prominently, high above and in every direction on a clock tower for everyone to see.

    <p>
      Before taking it as a universal fact of a presence of an enormous clock on the highest tower, I started searching for a counterexample. And I thought I didn’t have to search for long. Have you ever seen a clock on the bell tower of Notre Dame in Paris? Well, a short inquiry revealed that it does actually exist, however it definitely lost the competition for my attention to the intricate decoration and stained glass window of the cathedral. But has it always been there as a part of the original design, or was it added or later on? Who decided that clocks and consequently time should play such a central role in our lives and society?

      During the Corona lockdown, many of us are suddenly out of our most bemoaned problem: lack of time. With many of our usual activities like going out with friends, visiting a concert or simply commuting suddenly being forbidden, we find ourselves with spare time on our hands. And yet, we don’t seem to be overly happy to have this everyday nuisance cleared away. We have more time now, but apparently we are not happy with the available options to fill it with at first sight. 
      <br>
      Time is such a central element to all our social interactions and our (apparent) lack of it has defined our culture like no other. But it seems that the freedom to fill it with content of our own choosing is a central aspect of feeling content – an aspect that is currently (partly) absent. At the same time, it could also be seen as an expression of “always wanting what you can’t have”. Further, a large part of our (normal) day is not controlled by ourselves either, but by things we call “work” or appointments, hence also limiting our freedom. We accept this trade-off but struggle to accept the newfound space on its own terms. But this discussion on freedom and how we deal with it, might better be part of a next blog post.
