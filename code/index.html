      <p>Though it has largely taken a backseat to more casual styles over the last several years, traditional design is undergoing a renaissance of sorts, and we find ourselves falling for the stately rooms and beautiful antiques all over again.</p>
      <p>It's not difficult to deduce that traditional design is inspired by—you guessed it—tradition. Specifically, traditions of 18th and 19th-century European interiors, albeit in a more timeless approach. <b>Symmetry, harmony, and understated elegance</b> are defining traits.</p>
      <p>Classical furniture, intricate details, and rich colors abound in traditional interiors, resulting in decidedly formal yet functional spaces. Architecture is another important component, with detailed millwork such as crown molding and wainscoting playing a significant role.</p>
      <h3>Characteristics</h3>

        <li>Rich, warm and inviting feel</li>
        <li>Elegant and comforting</li>

      <p>The Bohemian style interior design, also simply known as <b>Boho</b>, began in the 19th century in Paris, France. It was inspired by artists, writers, performers, and nomads who believed creativity was more valuable than money — the original bohemians. With the convergence of their respective cultures, ideals, and refusal to conform to what was accepted, they inadvertently started an interior design trend.</p>
      <p>The bohemian style, named for those nomadic artists, intended to overturn beauty standards by tossing out the rules and <b>embracing the unconventional</b>. Bohemian design today is about incorporating many different things from different philosophies, parts of the world, and ways of life. The result is an eclectic style that's as diverse as the people who inspire it.</p>

        <li>Mostly bold colors</li>

      <p>Glam style is all about the <b>drama and elegance</b>. With materials that shine, like lucite, crystal, and brilliant metallics, this design style is nothing short of dazzling. Chic neutrals, brilliant metallics, and luscious fabrics – classic glam decor is an elegant interplay of the understated and overstated. With nods to the regency of old Hollywood, glam home decor is also decidedly of-the-moment and deceptively restrained. </p>
      <p> When shopping for glam designs, look to items that catch your eye and feel opulent or even <b>a little over-the-top</b>. Offset show-stopping pieces with traditional furniture designs to keep your space in harmony. Glam elements can be incorporated into your space and blended with other styles to create a unique look that still captures the magic of sparkle and shine.</p>
      <h3>Characteristics</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Gold or brass furniture</li>
      <li>Use of Faux Fur</li>
      <li>Marble surfaces</li>
      <li>Metallic accents</li>
      <li>Dramatic lighting</li>
