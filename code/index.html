      <h2 class="🦈">Welcome Shark lovers</h2>
      <p>This page is about the <mark><strong>"most fascinating and unknown"</strong></mark> species in the ocean.
        The sharks are ones of the oldest species on the planet.They are essential for the well-being of the oceans. There are around 1000 known species of sharks.
        Unfortunately,it suffers from the industrial fishing and its bad reputation because of the famous movies <mark><strong>Jaws</strong></mark>
        Humans do not really know those magnificent beasts and fail to understand that they are the only "lords of the seas".</p>
      <p>Here is a description from WWF's website:</p>
      <blockquote id="check" cite="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/shark">
        These majestic top predators that are so essential to the natural order of marine ecosystems now face their most severe threat from overfishing. Many species are threatened with extinction, with some families of rays such as sawfishes in peril. While sharks and rays have been an irreplaceable resource for coastal communities in the developing world for centuries, this unique balance is in danger of being lost forever.
        With our oceans severely degraded, restoring sharks is key to improving the resilience of these water bodies to climate change. While sharks' diverse range of species adds complexity to our conservation efforts, the dwindling numbers of these amazing creatures from overfishing and demand for their fins and meat increases the urgency of the task. Through our multi-pronged strategies, and guided by the Global Priorities for Conserving Sharks and Rays - A 2015-2025 Strategy, we strive to restore the balance between humans and sharks.
