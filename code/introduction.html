        <p> Tuxedoed birds with endearing personalities, 
            penguins are fascinating to young and old alike. 
            Clumsy and comical on land, they become beautifully graceful 
            swimmers below the ocean’s waves. <br>
            
            Penguins are birds of the ocean, spending up to 75 percent 
            of their lives in the water. Some penguins, like the fiordland 
            and rockhopper, have even been found with barnacles growing on 
            their feathers! <br> <br>
            Much of what seems odd about penguins is due to the fact that they 
            spend so much time in the water.<br> 
            Swimming is what penguins do best. A penguin’s awkward waddle may 
            seem comical on land but that’s because they are made to swim. 
            Adaptive wizards of the sea, their torpedo shaped bodies combined 
            with powerful flippers enable penguins to swim to considerable depths 
            and over great distances. Their legs and feet, located far back on 
            the body, contribute to the waddle on land, but underwater they act 
            as streamlined rudders that minimize drag.<br> <br>
            The adorable tuxedo serves a purpose in the water as well. 
            Called countershading, the black and white coloration helps camouflage 
            the birds from potential predators. When seen from below a white belly 
            better blends in with light-filled surface waters while from above a 
            black back looks similar to the dark hues of the deep ocean.
