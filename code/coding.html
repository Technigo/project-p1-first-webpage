    <h1>Coding...</h1>
    <p>Coding is like learning a new language and exploring a new culture. Since my school days I have loved learning new languages - French, English, Italian. With every new language you expand your horizon. This is exactly the same with coding. I was always very reserved when it came to computer stuff. I always had the feeling that it was a man's job to be able to do it and understand it. When I enrolled in a computer science course at university, it was all men with huge laptops with even bigger servers and I felt really lost with my MacBook Air. On top of that, I just couldn't find any connection with my classmates. So after a little more than a month I decided to replace the course with another lecture.</p>
    <p>Despite these experiences, I always had in mind that I would like to learn how to program a website one day. It's a way for me to express my creativity digitally and connect to my marketing degree. When I came across <a href="https://codeexcursion.ch/">Code Excusrion</a> in social media, I knew it was now or never.</p>
